## Description

Making a webpage for myself to display my portfolio and for networking. Consisting of a responsive layout, responsive images, and a consistent navbar. Three pages in total with an About me, a Contact, and a Portfolio page. Using media queries when necessary to keep the pages responsive, but using Bootstrap portfolio to minimize the need for them. Adding links to my Contact page so people can contact me and links to my Portfolio page so people can view my projects.

## Features

* Functional, deployed application

* GitHub repository with README describing the project

* Navbar consistent on each page.

* Navbar on each page contains links to About me, Contact, and Portfolio pages.

* All links work except for placeholder links on Portfolio page.

* Used semantic html.

* Each page has valid and correct HTML.

* Contains my personalized information. (bio, name, images, links to social media, etc.)

* Properly utilized Bootstrap components and grid system and only using a few media queries.

## Usage

* Click the navbar links to jump from page to page.

    *while on page the link to that page is inactive

* All three webpages are reactive from full screen on desktop all the way down to mobile devices.

* Linkedin and Github links take you to my profiles on each from Contact page

* Code Refactor project link and README link take you to the website page and open a readme in the browser respectively.

*Note: Links for placeholder projects do not work.
